## Warning

These files are usually automatically generated by the Pico SDK, however, I've put them here for simplicity's sake.
In a typical project, you would first run the Pico Build Action once to generate these headers (they will be generated at 
`{YOUR_BUILD_DIRECTORY}/generated/pico_base/pico`) (you can set the `cmake_config_only` option to `"true"` as we only need the 
build files), then run this action, and finally run Pico Build again. This is a janky solution, but it is the easiest way of doing it, 
if you don't want to manually copy the autogenerated headers in that is, which is not usually recommended.<br>

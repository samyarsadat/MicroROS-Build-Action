## Notes
Some extra notes on configuration and usage.

### The Environment Setup Script
The environment setup script, as described above, should setup the environment for building micro-ROS for the specific that you're building micro-ROS for.<br>
This may include installing compilers, SDKs, toolchains, setting environment variables, etc. An example of such a file can be found in the form of the default
setup script for the RP2040 _(see [rp2040_env_setup.sh](rp2040_env_setup.sh))_. This script installs the Pico SDK, along with all other required dependencies.<br>
<br>

### Full Raspberry Pi Pico Usage Example
To see this action in action _(no pun intended)_ along with the [Pico Build Action](https://github.com/samyarsadat/Pico-Build-Action), take a look at my
[ROS Robot Project](https://github.com/samyarsadat/ROS-Robot)! There you will find this action being used to build micro-ROS for the Raspberry Pi Pico along
with the aforementioned Pico Build Action for building the final binaries that can be used on the Pico.<br>
<br>
In my ROS Robot Project, I'm using the FreeRTOS kernel to enable multithreading for micro-ROS. Unfortunately, some platform-specific FreeRTOS header files import
an autogenerated header from the Pico SDK (`version.h`). This header is generated by the SDK at build time. This means that, unless we want to manually
copy it in, we have to run the Pico Build Action once before running this action. It doesn't matter if Pico Build fails because micro-ROS doesn't exist yet,
as the headers are generated before build steps that require micro-ROS. We will, of course, have to run Pico Build once again after this action.<br>
<br>
This is an incredibly janky solution, but it is the easiest way of doing, unless you want to manually copy the headers in, which is usually not recommended;
and who wants to do things manually when there's a way to automate it!<br>
<br>


## Example usage
```YAML
jobs:
    test_build:
        name: Build example micro-ROS library
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        permissions:
            contents: read

        steps:
            - name: Checkout
              uses: actions/checkout@v4
              with:
                  submodules: recursive

            - name: Build MicroROS Library
              id: build
              uses: ./
              with:
                  microros_dir: test_library/libmicroros
                  clone_microros_setup: "true"
```
